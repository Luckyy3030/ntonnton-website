    <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Ntonnton Kota Shop</strong>, the heart of <em>Polokwaneâ€™s street food culture</em>. 
        We are proud to serve one of South Africaâ€™s most loved meals â€” the <strong>kota</strong>. 
        Our shop was founded with one simple mission: to provide delicious, affordable, and 
        satisfying meals that bring people together. 
    </p>

    <p>
        At Ntonnton, we believe food is more than just something to eat â€” 
        it is an experience. Thatâ€™s why every kota is carefully prepared with 
        fresh ingredients, unique recipes, and a lot of love. 
        From the <em>Classic Kota</em> to our signature <em>Full House Kota</em>, 
        each bite is a celebration of flavour and culture. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Located in the vibrant city of Polokwane, our shop is a gathering place 
        for students, workers, families, and anyone who loves great food. 
        Over the years, we have become more than just a food stop; 
        we have grown into a community hub where people connect, 
        share stories, and enjoy a taste of home. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Our vision is to expand the love of kotas beyond Polokwane, 
        while staying true to our roots. We aim to keep improving our menu, 
        offering more variety, and making sure that every customer leaves 
        with a smile. At Ntonnton Kota Shop, your satisfaction is our top priority.
